# Credit Card Fraud Detection Script

This script utilizes Python libraries to analyze a credit card transaction dataset and build a model to identify 
fraudulent transactions.

## Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
scikit-learn
Instructions:

## Install Dependencies:

Bash
```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Use code with caution.

## Data Preparation:

Replace "creditcard.csv" with the actual path to your credit card transaction dataset.
Ensure the dataset contains a column named "Class" that indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

## Script Overview:

### Imports:

Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, modeling, and evaluation are imported.
### Data Loading:

The credit card transaction dataset is loaded using pandas.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional):

Commented-out code demonstrates how to create a scatterplot using seaborn to visualize the relationship between transaction 
amount and time, colored by transaction class. This can be helpful for gaining insights into potential patterns.

### Feature and Target Variable Separation:

All columns except the target class ("Class") are assigned to the x variable, representing the features used for model 
training.
The "Class" column is assigned to the y variable, representing the target variable (fraudulent or genuine).

### Data Splitting:
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. The test size is set to 35%, 
allowing the model to be evaluated on unseen data.
### Model Training:

#### Logistic Regression:

A Logistic Regression classifier is created with class_weight='balanced'. This helps address potential class imbalance 
(where fraudulent transactions are much fewer than genuine ones).
The model is trained on the training data (x_train and y_train).

### Random Forest Classifier (Optional):

Commented-out code demonstrates how to train a Random Forest Classifier with balanced class weights. This can be 
explored as an alternative model.

### Model Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the testing set using the trained model.
The model's performance is evaluated using:

#### Confusion matrix: 

Shows the correct and incorrect classifications for both fraudulent and genuine transactions.

#### Classification report: 

Provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

#### Accuracy: 

Measures the overall percentage of correct predictions.
The evaluation results are written to an output file (output.txt).

#### Additional Considerations:

##### Data Preprocessing: 

Explore feature scaling or normalization techniques to improve model performance.

##### Hyperparameter Tuning: 

Experiment with different parameters for the chosen model(s) to potentially achieve better results.

##### Feature Engineering: 

Consider creating new features based on domain knowledge or feature interactions.

##### Alternative Models: 

Explore other machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), or deep learning models.

##### Cost-Sensitivity: 

If false positives (failing to detect fraud) are more costly than false negatives 
(incorrectly flagging genuine transactions), adjust the model or decision threshold accordingly.

##### Regular Monitoring: 

Regularly retrain and evaluate the model with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

## Disclaimer:

This script is provided for educational purposes only. The effectiveness of fraud detection models depends on the quality 
and relevance of the training data. It's recommended to consult financial experts and adhere to security best practices 
when dealing with real-world credit card transactions.
