# Image Classifier using Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates how to build, train, and use an image classifier using deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing, and the trained model is saved for later use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy opencv-python
